        <h1>POVERTY AND PROFICIENCY</h1>

        <p class="dek">Low reading proficiency levels in children is a silent battle echoing throughout the country, and in Syracuse city’s elementary school classrooms. </p>

        <p>The literacy skills taught at a young age can make or break the future success of a student. Inadequate reading skills from third grade and beyond can determine the rest of a child’s K-12 school years, and their place in the workforce. 
</p>

        <p>“People are focusing on third grade reading levels because we know that kids that aren’t reading on grade level by third grade are more likely to drop out of school and not graduate on time,” said <https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurie-black-04b97125b/>Laurie Black</a>, community education director of United Way CNY Book Buddies. “It also becomes a social emotional struggle as well. So if you’re a struggling reader, you look around at the kids who aren’t struggling, you feel like there is something that is wrong with you.” 
</p>

        <p>Over half (59.6%) of Syracuse City School District (SCSD) students face economic struggles. Out of all of the students in SCSD, only a little over 21% scored proficient in reading skills in 2022. ( U.S. News & World Report,) Children who grow up in poverty deal with strong barriers to their education, lacking access to resources and reading reinforcement.

        <p> This is where the community steps in. 
</p>

        <p>Organizations such as CNY Book Buddies  one on one tutor SCSD children in reading, providing a safe place for these students to practice their reading skills once a week, outside of classroom time. 
</p>

        <p>“Struggling readers, which is the majority of students we are working with, usually find it hard to read. Our volunteers come in and keep kids excited about reading,” says Laurie Black. “Unfortunately, struggling readers need to practice more, not less. We have to build the space and the support.”

        <p>The improvement in reading skills in these children from simply having someone to listen to, or book resources readily available in school systems that children might not have access to in their home life.
